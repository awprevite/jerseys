# Dynamic Jersey Collection Website

Built with Javascript, React, and Next.js, this is a personal website that displays my hockey jersey collection. With an e-commerce style, users can view the collection in its entirety, or search, sort, and filter. Administrators have the ability to manage the collection by adding and deleting jerseys in a protected page. The site was designed for desktop, but still performs well on mobile devices.

Supabase was used for the back-end and its native Postgre SQL database and cloud storage were used for storing information and images.

Next I would like to include Supabases authentication to truly protect the administrative page.
